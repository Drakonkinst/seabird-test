# seabird-test

A simulation of seabird movements

## Testing Environment

This program will **not** work if run from a local file, so to run this
code locally you'll need to run a local server.

- Install the `http-server` npm module from npm or homebrew.
- Run `http-server` to start a local http server.
- Visit one of the addresses listed in the http-server startup message in your browser.
- This simulation was developed using the Google Chrome browser and was designed to be used with a keyboard and mouse.
